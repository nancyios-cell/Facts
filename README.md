# Facts
 This Project is build on SwiftUI which uses the [api](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2iodh4vg0eortkl/facts.json) to display data.
 
## Note:
1. Xcode 11.6 version is used lately which uses the latest deployment target i.e 13.6 OS
2. [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) pod is used to display the async images in SwiftUI.
  ```bash
  pod 'Kingfisher/SwiftUI'
  ```
  3.  There are few images or fields in response data which passes null values. So, SwiftUI shows the data accordingly.
